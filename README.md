### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Amadeo Mendez (he/him), and I'm currently developing my DataScience skills ðŸŒ±. I have almost one year of experience as an independent analyst, and I made some [scripts](https://github.com/AmadeoMz/Scripts_for_sales_control_in_my_brewery) that help me to control the sales of my side hustle and hobbie which is a small brewery.

I'm a physicist but I directed my way to data science, so I'm currently looking for a Jr. position to add value as a teammate, and enhance my technical skills.
