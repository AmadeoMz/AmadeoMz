### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Amadeo Mendez (he/him), a MSc. in physics with almost one year of experience working with large amount of data. 

I joined in my current job in the Data Analyst role, in which I performed ETL processes monitoring and automatization by using the Dataiku Python API (I'm an APIs enthusiast). Today I'm mainly working with Azure cloud in a Data Engineer role (Azure Data Factory, Azure Function App, Synapse Analytics, etc.)

As an independent analyst I made some [scripts](https://github.com/AmadeoMz/Scripts_for_sales_control_in_my_brewery) that help me to control the sales of my side hustle and hobbie which is a small brewery.

I keep myself studying every day, trying to improve my technique and expanding my range of skills.
