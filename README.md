### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Amadeo Mendez (he/him), and I'm currently developing my DataScience skills. ðŸŒ±
I have almost one year of experience as an independent analyst.
I made some [scripts](https://github.com/AmadeoMz/Scripts_for_sales_control_in_my_brewery) that help me to control the sales of my side hustle and hobbie which is a small brewery.
