### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Amadeo Mendez (he/him), and I'm still developing my data driven skills ðŸŒ±. I have almost one year of experience as an independent analyst, and I made some [scripts](https://github.com/AmadeoMz/Scripts_for_sales_control_in_my_brewery) that help me to control the sales of my side hustle and hobbie which is a small brewery.

I joined in my current job in the Data Analyst role, in which I performed ETL processes monitoring and automatization by using the Dataiku Python API (I'm an APIs enthusiast). Today I'm focus on working with Azure Data Factory.
